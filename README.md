# What game should I play?
A local hosted game picker website that uses [GiantBomb's](https://www.giantbomb.com/) API to show the user a random game, either completely random or for a specific platform, displaying the game's: cover, description, release date and a link to its page on [GiantBomb's](https://www.giantbomb.com/) website. The website is responsive. There is no hosted version, but you can try it yourself by using the command on the command terminal after navigating to the project's folder: `node .\index.js` or you can use `nodemon .\index.js` if you have the npm package and plan on editing the code youself. Don't forget to run `npm install` before trying to run the project.
